### 👋 About the Project

Ever felt lost scrolling through endless product listings? Me too. That’s why I built **ShopAI** — a smart, multimodal shopping assistant that answers your shopping queries using voice, text, and smart AI.

This is part of a broader AI GTM system I’m working on, and ShopAI is focused on making product discovery intuitive and intelligent — just like talking to a helpful friend who actually gets what you’re looking for.

- 🔍 Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch relevant product info
- 💬 Chats with users via a clean React frontend
- 🔥 Syncs user context and messages in real time with Firebase
- 🚀 Built for speed, scale, and clarity — with Groq API support
